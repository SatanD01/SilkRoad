                                <p>Uzbekistan's natural world is very diverse. It is composed of desert areas and snowy
                                    mountains, rivers and completely dry lands. The most part of its territory lies in
                                    the Turon plain, where there are no sudden steep-drops and hills. The Turon plate
                                    and mainland, which later became the Tian Shan and Pamir -Alai Mountains, were
                                    formed in the Paleolithic period. Later, the sea covered the plate for a long time.
                                    The mountain chains are thought to have fully developed during the Alps orogenesis.
                                    The mountain ranges blocked the humidity from the Indian Ocean. It caused
                                    considerable climatic change: the weather became dry and huge desert areas appeared.
                                    As rivers and winds kept changing their directions, the upper layer of soil was
                                    continuously displaced from one place to another. It led to the formation of the
                                    Kyzyl Kum and Kara Kum deserts. </p>
                                <p>Mountains and foothills make up about one-fifth of the territory of Uzbekistan. The
                                    highest point is 4,643 meters. Mountains cover the east of the country. Uzbekistan
                                    embraces western parts of the Tian Shan and Pamir-Alai mountain ranges,
                                    respectively. The mountain ranges are very different: there is a sharp contrast of
                                    heights, foothills, canyons, and watersheds.</p>
                                <p>There are also small mountains such as Aktau, Karakchitau and the western part of the
                                    Zarafshon mountain range with their smooth shape. Rather big depressions stretch
                                    between the mountains: Kashkadarya, Surkhandarya, Zarafshon, and Samarkand. The
                                    largest depression is the Ferghana Valley - 370 km long and 190 km wide. It is
                                    surrounded by mountain ranges on three sides except on the western face. On the
                                    border with Afghanistan, there is the huge Amu Darya depression.</p>

                                    in mountain areas than in plains. Special construction models are used in buildings

                                <p>The Sea is a saline endorheic basin in Central Asia; it lies between Kazakhstan
                                    (Aktobe and Kyzylorda provinces) in the north and Karakalpakstan, an autonomous
                                    region of Uzbekistan, in the south. The name roughly translates as "Sea of Islands",
                                    referring to more than 1,534 islands that once dotted its waters.</p>
                                <p> Formerly one of the four largest lakes in the world with an area of 68,000 square
                                    kilometres (26,300 sq mi), the Aral Sea has been steadily shrinking since the 1960s
                                    after the rivers that fed it were diverted by Soviet Union irrigation projects. By
                                    2007 it had declined to 10% of its original size, splitting into four lakes – the
                                    North Aral Sea and the eastern and western basins of the once far larger South Aral
                                    Sea and one smaller lake between North and South Aral Sea. By 2009, the
                                    south-eastern lake had disappeared and the south-western lake retreated to a thin
                                    strip at the extreme west of the former southern sea. The maximum depth of the North
                                    Aral Sea is 42 m (138 ft) (as of 2008).</p>
                                <p> The region's once prosperous fishing industry has been virtually destroyed, bringing
                                    unemployment and economic hardship. The Aral Sea region is also heavily polluted,
                                    with consequent serious public health problems. The retreat of the sea has
                                    reportedly also caused local climate change, with summers becoming hotter and drier,
                                    and winters colder and longer.[5]The destruction of the Aral Sea ecosystem has been
                                    sudden and severe. Beginning in the 1960s, agricultural demands have deprived this
                                    large Central Asian salt lake of enough water to sustain itself, and it has shrunk
                                    rapidly. Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and other Central Asian states use this water to
                                    grow cotton and other export crops, in the face of widespread environmental
                                    consequences, including fisheries loss, water and soil contamination, and dangerous
                                    levels of polluted airborne sediments. It is generally agreed that the current
                                    situation is unsustainable, but export dependency of the Central Asian states have
                                    prevented real action, and the sea continues to shrink.</p>
                                <p> It is no exaggeration to say that the case of the Aral Sea is one of the greatest
                                    environmental catastrophes ever recorded. Humans have made use of the waters of the
                                    Aral basin for thousands of years, borrowing from its two major rivers: the Amu
                                    Darya, which flows into the Aral Sea from the south; and the Syr Darya, which
                                    reaches the sea at its north end. As the twentieth century began, irrigated
                                    agriculture in the basin was still being conducted at asustainable level. After the
                                    Russian Empire was replaced by the Soviet Union, this began to change. Traditional
                                    agricultural practices were destroyed by collectivization, and Soviet planners
                                    sought products that could be exported for hard currency. They placed cotton high on
                                    their list, calling it `white gold,' and the Soviet Union became a net exporter of
                                    cotton in 1937. Change accelerated in the 1950s, as Central Asian irrigated
                                    agriculture was expanded and mechanized. The Kara Kum Canal opened in 1956,
                                    diverting large amounts of water from the Amu Darya into the desert of Turkmenistan,
                                    and millions of hectares of land came under irrigation after 1960. A crucial
                                    juncture had been reached, and after 1960 the level of the Aral Sea began to drop,
                                    while diversion of water continued to increase. While the sea had been receiving
                                    about fifty cubic kilometers of water per year in 1965, by the early 1980s this had
                                    fallen to zero. As the Aral shrank, its salinity increased, and by 1977 the formerly
                                    large fish catch had declined by over seventy-five percent. By the early 1980s,
                                    commercially useful fish had been eliminated, shutting down an industry that had
                                    employed 60,000. The declining sea level lowered the water table in the region,
                                    destroying many oases near its shores. The devotion to irrigated agriculture had
                                    other direct effects as well. Much ecologically sensitive land in the river deltas
                                    was converted to cropland, and pesticide use was heavy throughout the Aral basin,
                                    resulting in heavy contaminant concentrations in the sea. Overirrigation caused salt
                                    buildup in many agricultural areas. By the beginning of the 1990s, the surface area
                                    of the Aral had shrunk by nearly half, and the volume was down by seventy-five
                                    percent. A host of secondary effects began to appear. Regional climate became more
                                    continental, shortening the growing season and causing some farmers to switch from
                                    cotton to rice, which demanded even more diverted water. The exposed area of former
                                    seabed was now over 28,000 square kilometers, from which winds picked up an
                                    estimated 43 million tons of sediments laced with salts and pesticides, with
                                    devastating health consequences for surrounding regions. These contaminated Aral
                                    dust storms have been reported as far away as the Arctic and Pakistan. Respiratory
                                    illnesses were particularly common, and throat cancers burgeoned. Regional
                                    vegetation loss may have increased albedo, possible reducing precipitation.</p>

                                <p>The Amu Darya was called the Oxus by the ancient Greeks. In ancient times, the river
                                    was regarded as the boundary between Irān and Tūrān. The river's drainage lies in
                                    the area between the former empires of Genghis Khan and Alexander the Great,
                                    although they occurred at much different times. One southern route of the Silk Road
                                    ran along part of the Amu Darya northwestward from Termez before going westwards to
                                    the Caspian Sea.</p>
                                <p> It is believed that the Amu Darya's course across the Kara-Kum Desert has gone
                                    through several major shifts in the past few thousand years. Much of the time, the
                                    most recent period being in the 13th century to the late 16th century, the Amu Darya
                                    emptied into both the Aral and the Caspian Seas, the latter via a large distributary
                                    called the Uzboy River. The Uzboy splits off from the main channel just south of the
                                    Amudarya Delta. Sometimes, the flow through the two branches was more or less equal,
                                    but often, most of the Amu Darya's flow split to the west and flowed into the
                                    Caspian.</p>
                                <p> People began to settle along the lower Amu Darya and the Uzboy in the 5th century
                                    A.D., establishing a thriving chain of agricultural lands, towns, and cities. The
                                    river was impounded in about 985 A.D. at the bifurcation of the forks by the massive
                                    Gurganj Dam, which diverted water to the Aral. The dam was destroyed by Genghis
                                    Khan's troops in 1221, and the Amu Darya shifted its flows more or less equally
                                    between the main stem and the Uzboy. But in the 18th century, the river again turned
                                    north, flowing into the Aral Sea, a path it has taken since. Less and less water
                                    flowed down the Uzboy until, in the 1720s, the river's surface flow completely dried
                                    up. The first British explorer to reach the region in the Great Game period was a
                                    naval officer called John Wood. He was sent on an expedition to find the source of
                                    the river in 1839. He found modern day Lake Zorkul, called it Lake Victoria and
                                    proclaimed he had found the source.</p>
                                <p> The Soviet Union became the ruling power in the 20th century. The Soviet Union fell
                                    in the 1990s and Central Asia split up into the many smaller countries that lie
                                    within or partially within the Amu Darya basin. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Amu
                                    Darya and Syr Darya were first used by the Soviets to irrigate extensive cotton
                                    fields in the Central Asian plain. Before this time, water from the rivers was
                                    already being used for agriculture, but not on this massive scale. The Qaraqum
                                    Canal, Karshi Canal, and Bukhara Canal were among the larger of the irrigation
                                    diversions built. The Main Turkmen Canal was a proposed project that would have
                                    diverted water along the dry Uzboy River bed into central Turkmenistan, but was
                                    never built.</p>
                                <p>The river's total length is 2,400 kilometres (1,500 mi) and its drainage basin totals
                                    534,739 square kilometres (206,464 sq mi) in area, providing a mean discharge of
                                    around 97.4 cubic kilometres (23.4 cu mi) of water per year. The river is navigable
                                    for over 1,450 kilometres (900 mi). All of the water comes from the high mountains
                                    in the south where annual precipitation can be over 1,000 mm (39 in). Even before
                                    large-scale irrigation began, high summer evaporation meant that not all of this
                                    discharge reached the Aral Sea - though there is some evidence the large Pamir
                                    glaciers provided enough melt water for the Aral to overflow during the 13th and
                                    14th centuries A.D.</p>
                                <p> One source of the Amu Darya is the Pamir River, which emerges from Lake Zorkul (once
                                    also known as Lake Victoria) in the Pamir Mountains (ancient Mount Imeon), and flows
                                    west to Qila-e Panja, where it joins the Wakhan River to form the Panj River.
                                    Another claimed source of the Amu Darya is an ice cave at the end of the Wakhjir
                                    valley, in the Wakhan Corridor, in the Pamir Mountains, near the border with
                                    Pakistan. A glacier turns into the Wakhan River and joins the Pamir River about 50
                                    kilometres (31 mi) downstream.</p>
                                <p> The Panj River forms the border of Afghanistan and Tajikistan. It flows west to
                                    Ishkashim where it turns north and then east north-west through the Pamirs passing
                                    the Tajik-Afghan Friendship Bridge. It subsequently forms the border of Afghanistan
                                    and Uzbekistan for about 200 kilometres (120 mi), passing Termez and the
                                    Afghanistan-Uzbekistan Friendship Bridge. It delineates the border of Afghanistan
                                    and Turkmenistan for another 100 kilometres (62 mi) before it flows into
                                    Turkmenistan at Atamyrat. As the Amudarya, it flows across Turkmenistan south to
                                    north, passing Türkmenabat, and forms the border of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan from
                                    Halkabat. It is then split into many waterways that are used to form the river delta
                                    joining the Aral Sea, passing Urgench, Daşoguz and other cities, but it does not
                                    reach what is left of the sea anymore and is lost in the desert.</p>
                                <p> Use of water from the Amu Darya for irrigation has been a major contributing factor
                                    to the shrinking of the Aral Sea since the late 1950s.</p>

                                <p>The name, which comes from Persian and has long been used in the East, is a
                                    relatively recent one in western writings; prior to the early 20th century, the
                                    river was known by various versions of its ancient Greek name. Following the Battle
                                    of Jaxartes the river marked the northernmost limit of Alexander the Great's
                                    conquests. Greek historians have claimed that here in 329 BC he founded the city
                                    Alexandria Eschate (literally, "Alexandria the Furthest") as a permanent garrison.
                                    The city is now known as Khujand. In reality, he had just renamed (and possibly,
                                    expanded) the city of Cyropolis founded by king Cyrus the Great of Persia, more than
                                    two centuries earlier.</p>
                                <p>The river rises in two headstreams in the Tian Shan Mountains in Kyrgyzstan and
                                    eastern Uzbekistan—the Naryn River and the Kara Darya—and flows for some 2,212
                                    kilometres (1,374 mi) west and north-west Uzbekistan and southern Kazakhstan to the
                                    remains of the Aral Sea. The Syr Darya drains an area of over 800,000 square
                                    kilometres (310,000 sq mi), but no more than 200,000 square kilometres (77,000 sq
                                    mi) actually contribute significant flow to the river. Its annual flow is a very
                                    modest 37 cubic kilometres (30,000,000 acre ft) per year—half that of its sister
                                    river, the Amu Darya.</p>
                                <p> Along its course, the Syr Darya irrigates the most fertile cotton-growing region in
                                    the whole of Central Asia, together with the towns of Kokand, Khujand, Kyzylorda and
                                    Turkestan.</p>
                                <p> An extensive system of canals, many built in the 18th century by the Uzbek Khanate
                                    of Kokand, spans the regions the river flows through. Massive expansion of
                                    irrigation canals during the Soviet period, to irrigate cotton fields, caused
                                    ecological damage to the area, with the river drying up long before reaching the
                                    Aral Sea which, as a result, has shrunk to a small remnant of its former size. With
                                    millions of people now settled in these cotton areas, it is not clear how the
                                    situation can be rectified.</p>

                                <p>The Aydar Lake is part of the man-made Aydar-Arnasay system of lakes, which covers an
                                    area of 4,000 square kilometres (1,500 mi<sup>2</sup>). This system includes 3
                                    brackish water lakes (Aydar Kul, Arnasay and Tuzkan) located in the saline
                                    depressions of the south-eastern Kyzyl Kum (now in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan). The
                                    lakes are the unintentional byproduct of Soviet planning.</p>
                                <p>Up to the middle of the last century the Arnasay lowland remained a dry Salt pan
                                    during most of the year. Only in Spring, in the lowlands, would the small, ephemeral
                                    Lake Tuzkan glisten briefly, disappearing in the hot weather.</p>
                                <p>In the early sixties the Syr Darya was dammed up. Simultaneously the Chardarya
                                    irrigation dam was constructed. Floodgates were provided in the dam for flood
                                    control, and when in 1969 a raging flood occurred, these were opened as the dam's
                                    capacity was inadequate to cope with the flow. Between February 1969 and February
                                    1970 almost 60% of the Syr Darya's average annual water flow (21 km<sup>3</sup>) was
                                    drained from the Chardarya Reservoir into the Arnasay lowland. In such a way new
                                    lakes were unintentionally created. Since 1969 the Aydar Lake has regularly received
                                    the waters of the Syr Darya River when they overflow the capacity of the Chardarya
                                    Reservoir. This has gradually filled up the natural cavity of Arnasay lowland to
                                    create the second largest lake in the region (after the remains of the Aral Sea).
                                </p>
                                <p>In 2005 the Aydar Lake contained 44.3 cubic kilometers of water. Today the area of
                                    the Aydar Lake amounts 3,000 square kilometres (1,200 mi<sup>2</sup>). It is nearly
                                    250 km (160 miles) long and up to 15 km (9 miles) wide. The mineralization of the
                                    water in the Aydar Lake averages only 2 grams per liter (2,000 ppm).</p>
                                <p>Many sorts of fish including the (Sazan) (Cyprinus caprio), Pike perch (Stizostedion
                                    lucioperca), Bream (Abramis brama), Cat-fish (Silurus glanis), Hzereh (Aspius
                                    aspius), Chehon (Pelecus cultratus) Ophidian fish (Channa argus) were introduced to
                                    the Lake, which nowadays works as a source of industrial fishing. The lake system
                                    provides between 760 and 2,000 tones of fish annually (according to statistical data
                                    between 1994 and 2001).</p>
                                <p>In addition to fauna common in the Kyzyl Kum, there are many kinds of water birds
                                    migrating from the Aral Sea that make their homes around the lake.</p>
                                <p>The Aydar Lake is located away from inhabited localities, therefore there is perfect
                                    silence around the lake. At the present time 345 families (approx. 1,760 people)
                                    reside near the lake.</p>
                                <p>The region of the Aydar Lake is an area of great potential for fishing, yurting and
